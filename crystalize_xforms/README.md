# crystalize_xforms

## Installation

There are multiple ways to do this.  You can simply clone this git repo, or you can load them in individually.

The installation directory on windows will be:

    %appdata%\Chaotica\user_transforms

You can create this folder if it doesn't already exist and it does support subfolders.

If you clone this git repo you can use this method:

> windows command line  **note: git must be installed**

    cd %appdata%\Chaotica
    mkdir user_transforms
    cd user_transforms
    git clone https://git.pugnacious.site/Crystalize/crystalize_xforms.git

This method will create a subfolder called **crystalize_xforms** and everything can be loaded in underneath that.
