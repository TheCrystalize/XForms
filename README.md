# crystalize_xforms

## Installation

There are multiple ways to do this.  You can simply clone this git repo, or you can load them in individually.

The installation directory on windows will be:

    %appdata%\Chaotica\user_transforms

You can create this folder if it doesn't already exist and it does support subfolders.

If you clone this git repo you can use this method:

> windows command line  **note: git must be installed**

    cd %appdata%\Chaotica
    mkdir user_transforms
    cd user_transforms
    git clone https://git.pugnacious.site/Crystalize/crystalize_xforms.git

This method will create a subfolder called **crystalize_xforms** and everything can be loaded in underneath that.

## Transform Previews

Thanks to the efforts of the community and most especially SirFancy, the transform previews have been generated for most of the main branch.
They are found in the transform_thumbs.zip file.  To install them, locate the Chaotica program directory and put them in the /data/transform_thumbs folder alongside the default images.
